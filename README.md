# Ubuntu-clean

My ubuntu i3 desktop setup.

After cloning the repo just run ./install.sh from a non-root user. This updates ubuntu and installs a lot of stuff, so it will take a while. Feel free to optimize ;)

## Installation

```
./install.sh
```

After the script is done reboot and select i3 (top right corner) on the login screen. Then open a terminal (`ctrl+return`) run `lxappearance`and select ark-dark theme and change the icons to whatever you like (I used papyrus)
